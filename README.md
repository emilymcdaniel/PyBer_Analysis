## Overview
In this analysis, we dive into PyBer's data to examine the impact of city type (rural, suburban, or urban) on PyBer's business. We notice the the number of rides, drivers, individual riders, and fares vary. The purpose of the analysis is to identify trends within each city type and to compare the differences across the 3 city types. 

The chart below is a summary of PyBer's business, with the variables discussed above denoted here.

### Rural
Rural areas have the fewest rides and drivers and total fares, but their average fare per ride and per rider are the highest. There is little variation in the total fares between Jan 1, 2019 - April 29, 2019.

### Suburban
Here, we see the number of total rides is fairly close to the number of total drivers. The fares from all views fall between urban and rural areas. Between Jan 1, 2019 - April 29, 2019, fares spike at the end of February and April.

### Urban 
In urban areas, we see the highest volume of rides, number of drivers and the total fares. However, the average fare per driver and per rider is the lowest. It is no surprise that lower fares will result in increased interest from riders. However, the high volume of drivers is curious considering the steep drop in earnings in fare per trip. Between Jan 1, 2019 - April 29, 2019, a sustained increase in overall city fares occurred.

## Business Recommendations
The following recommendations are based on the data provided and additional considerations:
1. Should the number of drivers be reduced or increased in suburban areas? Survey drivers, and ask them how they engage with PyBer. 
   - Are they frequently looking for new trips and none are available? 
   - Are they only interested in driving during small time windows or within specific areas?
   - Does the length of the trip affect your willingness to accept the trip?
   - Does the region of the trip affect your willingness to accept the trip?
2. Consider why urban drivers are willing to make trips for less fares per trip. Pull data to determine:
   - Whether drivers complete multiple trips simultaneously
   - How many trips each driver completes, on average, per day.
   - How does time of day or time of week impact?
3. Examine needs of rural areas.
   - Do rural trips typically originate and end at common locations?
   - What is the demographic of customers who currently use PyBer in rural areas? 
   - How can we better market to other demographics who could take advantage of this service? Consider the elderly, handicapped, underage, etc.
